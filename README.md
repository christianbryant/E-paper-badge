# 7 Color E-Paper Display Badge (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)

This project is for the software side of development for my custom 7-color E-Paper Display Badge. 
My passion for this project is driven by my experience attending Conventions and wanting something to showcase art, messages, or any type of image. 
This device follows these set of rules:
```
1. Must be power-efficient
2. Must be compact
3. Must be non-technical user-friendly
4. Must be cost-effective
5. Must be fully open-source
```

* Take a look into MicroPython implementation to allow the user to just upload png data to the device.
